# Webscraping-python

There are comments in every script explaning the function of each code block and which packages to install.
Please have a good look at the Biopython package (http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#sec141),
because this package has a lot of potential. It could be used to automate BLAST, SwissProt or KEGG queries as well.
